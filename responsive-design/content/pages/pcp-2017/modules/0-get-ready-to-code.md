###Exercise/s

1. Activity: **Marching Orders**

	Would it be good if people followed instructions exactly?  What would happen if you pointed to a closed door and said, “Go through that door”?

	Computers work by following lists of instructions, and they do exactly what the instructions say—even if they don’t make sense! 

	Your task: 

	- Pair up.  Select one person to be the **Artist** and the other to be the **Instructor**.
	- Instructor describes the picture provided to them to the Artist.  
	- Artist can ask questions to clarify instructions.
	Switch! 
	- Switch roles and switch pictures with a neighboring group.  Repeat the above but this time the Artist can’t ask questions to clarify instructions!
