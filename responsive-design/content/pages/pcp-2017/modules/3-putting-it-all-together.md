##<a id="32-cumproject">3.2. Cumulative Project - Your Landing Page</a>

It's time to launch your landing page!

We've been working all week on HTML and CSS for our personal landing page.  Now is the time to make it better!  The website for this cumulative project must include at least 2 pages, media, and use modern, valid HTML and CSS. 

You also may choose to use a CSS framework if you like. Some example frameworks include [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/), or [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/). 

In evaluating your work, I will be checking for the following:

- Directory structure: organize your code in a logical structure. Is your code organized in a manner that is logical? You have seen many examples of appropriate directory structures in our work so far. 
- Layout:  Does your website's layout meaningfully improve the appearance and understandability of your content?  Is the website clean with an easy-to-follow navigation system that contributes to a usable webpage layout?  Is the content on the website easy to find? 
- Code quality: write valid HTML and CSS. The w3c consortium has an excellent [code validator](http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) which tells you if your html page is valid.  There is also a [CSS validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). Copy/paste or upload your files to the validator, and fix any errors! 
- Code readability: write code that is readable by using appropriate formatting (e.g., filenames and tags are all lowercase) and appropriate comments where applicable. Udacity has an excellent [style guide](http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/) which you should read/use for code readability.
- Presentation: Does your presentation thoughtfully and effectively describe the purpose of your website, the technologies used, reflection and issues, and next steps?

Bonus: Responsiveness - Is your page optimized for viewing on a smaller screen than our classroom computers (whether the smaller screen be a smaller browser window or, if you want to challenge yourself, another device like a smartphone)?

[Here is the rubric](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16R3-3RxSZ5zkiMJ-rCI37dN3IvtFlt3onJDjqsmp5dE/edit?usp=sharing) on which it will be graded.

##General tips and suggested steps to follow

- Wireframe first! 
- Focus first on the layout of your pages. Perhaps, add a grid to your CSS, then set up boxes with the right sizes
- Once you have the basic layout, fill in pieces. Start with common pieces like headers and footers 
- You don’t have to use a framework. The best thing a framework gives you is a grid, and responsive layout. If you do decide to use a framework, don’t copy all the CSS code to your project. Instead, add a link to the CSS code hosted on a CD to your HTML doc (in the head). For example:
	- Twitter Bootstrap: http://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.4/css/bootstrap.min.css
	- Zurb Foundation: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/foundation/5.5.1/css/foundation.min.css

####Step 1: Get content ready!

Scenario: Your top choice for college loves that you can code and wants to learn more about you.  Show yourself off.  

Revisit your landing page, and get content ready for launch. Without any code, write in your notebook what you'd like to include on your landing page.  Make sure the page is all about you. Think about what you can change and/or add content.  What is your background?  What are your accomplishments? What are your hobbies?  What else are you proud of?  

Content could review the following information about you:

- Your name and picture
- A little bit about who you are
- Your contact details (Twitter handle, email, etc.) with links
- Recent work
- Your skills

####Step 2: Decide on a 2nd page

Your website must include at least 2 pages.  For the second page, here are a few ideas:

- An "about" page
- A "contact" page
- A page that details a project you've worked on in the past

####Step 3: Create wireframes


- Watch: [What is a Wireframe?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0vt3nLZKks)
- Read: [The 5 Steps of a Professional UX Design Process](http://skillcrush.com/2014/06/24/5-ux-design-deliverables/)
- Prepare your wireframes for both pages on your site.  You're encouraged to use the same layout for both pages.  For wireframes, paper is perfectly fine or you can use an online tool like Google Docs, Google Slides, or an official wireframing tool like [balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/products/mockups/) (don’t buy it, just use free trial).

####Step 4: Start Building! - Set up your pages 
- Set up a local project directory, and make sure you put it under version control with git
- Set up the shell of your HTML and CSS pages 

####Step 5: Keep Building!

- Continue building out your pages
- See [what I will check when evaluating your work](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16R3-3RxSZ5zkiMJ-rCI37dN3IvtFlt3onJDjqsmp5dE/edit?usp=sharing).
	- Also, consider including the following:

		- Two images--e.g. one for the headshot and another for background
		- HTML elements 
			- Header element containing an image element
			- Input element for the email submission
			- Content about you using at least 6 different elements. For example, use ```<p>``` to introduce yourself.
			- Elements that will not count for the 6: ```<head>```, ```<body>```, ```<html>```, ```<header>```, and ```<input>```.
			- Content reviews the following information about you:
				- Your name and picture, a little bit about who you are, your contact details (Twitter handle, email, etc.), recent work, and your skills
		- CSS
			- Add a background image to the body
			- Add at least 10 CSS rules -- e.g. color, size, or font of text,  color of ‘submit’ button, shape of headshot or other image
			- Use ID in at least one CSS rule
			- Use class in at least one CSS rule 


####Step 6: Validate
- Run your HTML pages through: [http://validator.w3.org/](http://validator.w3.org/)
- Run your CSS page through: [https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

####Step 7: Use Github to deploy!*

- Create a repo on Github and upload your code there.
- Then follow [these directions](/resources/git-upload-and-deploy-pcp) to deploy.

*We will take care of this on Fridy at the start of class.

####Step 8: Submit!

- Use [this form](http://goo.gl/forms/tR4VCzCIx5fb7Eff1) to submit your project. You'll need a link to your Github repo and a link to your landing page.


####Step 9: Present

- During the final class on Friday, 7/15, you will have 3 minutes to present your website to your peers.
- In your presentation, please cover the following--
	- **The purpose of your website**: what did you decide to highlight on your page? Why did you decide to build it?  Who would or could find your website useful (i.e. target audience)?
	- **Technologies you used**: what technologies did you use (e.g. HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, etc.) and why? 
	- **Reflection**: what did you learn about HTML, CSS, and responsive design? What did you learn about web development? What would you improve if you had more time?  In hindsight, what might have you done differently?
	- **Struggles/issues**: what struggles and problems did you encounter (technological and/or personal)?
	- **What's next**: In its next iteration, how will/would you make it better?
